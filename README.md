<h1 align="center">3M - Magisk Module Manageer</h1>

3M (or MMM for friends) is a Magisk module manager. It is actually very basic for now, being able to:
* Create projects with all required and optional files
* Push projects to Magisk automatically
* List directories and files

### Warning:
This is a very, very sideproject, so i don't have any intentions on making it "the best helper for creating Magisk modules". I just created it because, as i work on my projects, i also like to work on other small things, and i rooted my phone and want to create Magisk modules just for fun. So don't expect the best features or anything like that. Besides it having releases, they are not even close to stable, and you may (and will) encounter bugs and also expect more features.
I will work more on this project, but it won't become my main project by any means.

### If you want to help me:
Just create issues and create commits. This can make the project better and can really make this project usefull for large scale on future.

### Thx for reading :blush:
